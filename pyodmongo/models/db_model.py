    Base class for all models in PyODMongo, using PyOdmongoMeta as its metaclass.
    This class provides the foundational structure for other models, enabling
    the integration of database-specific configurations and behaviors.

    Attributes:
        None (The class itself does not define any attributes; it serves as a
              base for other models to extend and utilize the provided metaclass.)

    Methods:
        None (The class does not define any methods; it relies on the metaclass

class DbModel(BaseModel, metaclass=DbMeta):
    """
    Base class for all database models using PyODMongo with auto-mapped fields
    to MongoDB documents. Provides automatic timestamping and ID management,
    along with utilities for managing nested dictionary fields.

    Attributes:
        id (Id | None): Unique identifier for the database record, typically
                        mapped to MongoDB's '_id'.
        created_at (datetime | None): Timestamp indicating when the record was
                                      created.
        updated_at (datetime | None): Timestamp indicating when the record was
                                      last updated.
        model_config (ConfigDict): Configuration dictionary to control model
                                   serialization and deserialization behaviors.
        _pipeline (ClassVar): Class variable to store pipeline operations for
                              reference resolution.

    Methods:
        __init__(**attrs): Initializes a new instance of DbModel, applying
                           transformations to nested dictionary fields to clean
                           up empty values.
        __remove_empty_dict(dct): Recursively removes empty dictionaries from
                                  nested dictionary fields, aiding in the
                                  cleanup process during initialization.
