    Metaclass for creating and configuring PyODMongo models. This metaclass extends

    - Setting and tracking the `__pyodmongo_complete__` attribute to ensure proper
      initialization of database-related features.
    - Applying necessary transformations to class fields for database compatibility.
    - Providing custom attribute access behavior for dynamically generated attributes.

                                       configuration is complete.

    Methods:
        __new__(cls, name, bases, namespace, **kwargs): Constructs a new class instance,
            applying database-specific initializations.
        __getattr__(cls, name): Custom attribute access method supporting dynamic
            attribute retrieval based on model fields.
