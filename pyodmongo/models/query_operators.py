                              the logical AND ('$and') operator.
        __or__(self, value): Combines the current operator with another using

    Attributes:
        path_str (str): The string representation of the path to the field in the database
                        document, used to identify the field to which the operation applies.
        operator (str): The comparison operator (e.g., '$eq', '$gt', '$lt', etc.) that
                        defines the type of comparison to be performed.
        value (Any): The value to compare against the field specified by path_str. The type
                     of this value can vary depending on the field type and the specific
                     operation being performed.
